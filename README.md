# Ansible Bootstrap Collection

This is an Ansible collection that provides a set of roles to apply some basic
starting configuration to private servers I manage. It is not meant as a fully
fledged, reusable collection with a wide range of use cases, but rather as a
starting point for my own infrastructure.

As such it will not be pushed to Ansible Galaxy, but will instead be used
internally alongside other playbooks and roles I've written. Sooner or later
this repository might be merged with another one into a single collection for
internal use. Until then, this one will be referenced as a dependency fetched
directly from Git by Ansible.
