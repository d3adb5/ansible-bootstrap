# Ansible Playbooks

This repository houses Ansible playbooks used for my personal projects. They're
responsible for carrying out tedious tasks on the servers I have set up for one
reason or another.

Its purpose is really to get me familiarized with Ansible, with the convenience
of not having to set things up manually being an added bonus.
